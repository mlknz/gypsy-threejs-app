# Spaceship Indweller.

First person adventure with [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

I have uploaded most of 3d assets to [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/mlknz).

Software used: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Substance tools](https://www.allegorithmic.com/), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Wall and floor textures are created with [this incredible sci-fi tile generator](https://share.allegorithmic.com/libraries/889).
